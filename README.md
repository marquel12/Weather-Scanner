# Weather-Scanner
The purpose of this application was to build a weather dashboard application that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser. This will generate a 5 day weather report based on which city the user input.


This was a big challenge for me as I was not able to complete this application on time. 
I will work on this further to understand what did wrong in my code.
Connecting the server to the openweather API has been my biggest challenge. I will review and debug to fix this issue.
